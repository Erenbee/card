## Documentation

### What is the project attempting to deliver and how did you deliver it?
This project is aiming to deliver a representation of 
the type of coding and design I can do as a graphic designer 
and creative coder. Doing different animations and hover effects, 
backgrounds and svgs, and links to different sites to show how to 
get in contact with me shows how I delivered a representation of 
what I can do. 

### What did you learn?
I learned how to manipulate different svg files, 
how to make certain layers animate, how to have different hover 
effects for the different svg links, problem solving and patience 
when working out the mobile view as well as the different desktop 
views. 

### What makes your project stand out?
Personal logo, animating the background of that svg and 
hover effects of the icons are some of the feature that are shown.

### How did you address accessibility on the web site (image alt text)
I addressed accessibility on my website by describing the different 
svgs and backgrounds people can see on the site, and making sure 
colors and fonts are easily readable. 

### How did you create your mock-ups
I created mock-up through going through the process of Pinterest boards of 
various different themes I was looking for and then taking my personal logo 
and incorporating it into the tarot card and puffy paint vibe I was aiming for.

### Talk a bit about how you developed your personal branding. Was this new or something you have been developing for awhile?
I have only done a personal logo once and it was the bare minimum basic and 
needed touch ups, so I took the opportunity to refine my work, I also love 
the moon and the night sky that's why I included it, it also reminds me of 
the personal branding for the club I am a vice president of K-pop Dance 
Crew (KDC) so I still have a little bit of my personal life added in as well as professional view of what I can do as a graphic designer and creative 
coder. 

### Was this your first web page?
Not necessarily, I have coded once before in my class in highschool, 
doing the basic html bare minimum, but this was a lot more advanced than drop 
down menus and different pages on a site, this one has animation and svgs and 
a little more in depth coding as well as it actually being upload to the web.

### What fonts you used and why?
I used the same font as I did in my personal logo business card as well as 
another deco font that is also easy to read that fits the theme I was going for.
